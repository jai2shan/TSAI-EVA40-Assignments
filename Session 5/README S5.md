## Session 5


### Assignment 5 - Trail 2
Target for Assignment
99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement) Less than or equal to 15 epochs
Less than 10000 Parameters

Target for Trial 2
1) Changing the learning rate to 0.025 so that we can hit the max accuracy in the early stages of epochs
2) Trying 0.02,0.025 and 0.03 to choose the best parameter

Results
Best accuracy (Train) - 98.97%
Best accuracy (Test) - 99.47%
Total Parameters - 9752

Analysis
0.03 is giving better performance on observing the Test Accuracy graph we can observe the max point of the accuracy is hitting around epoch 10, if that can be achieved around 6th epoch, LR scheduler can make the test accuracy stable which can be tried in next attempt
